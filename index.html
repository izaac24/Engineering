           <h2> <b>8/25/23</b>- This is my first journal entry!</h2> 
            <br>
            We have done alot since I first started this class. We made our own website which is this website.
            We went over some slides about saftey which was alot of dont mess around in class. Don't stab people with knives.
            I thought that the video and presentation were very funny while teaching something at the same time.
            <br>
            We also went over the Engineering process which is all about the steps to it. First you ask a question, then you imagine solutions.
            After that you plan your solutions, then you make prototypes for your solution, then you test your prototypes, then you improve and start over again from the beginning.

            On thursday we did a challenge where we were split into two teams. Each team got 9 pvc pipes and we were supposed to carry a marble from one point into a cup.
            I thought it was alot of fun and i met alot of new people becuase of it.
            I thought that this week was extreamly fun and I think that I am going to love this class.
