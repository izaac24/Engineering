            <br>
            We have done alot since I first started this class. We made our own website which is this website.
            We went over some slides about saftey which was alot of dont mess around in class. Don't stab people with knives.
            I thought that the video and presentation were very funny while teaching something at the same time.
            <br>
            We also went over the Engineering process which is all about the steps to it. First you ask a question, then you imagine solutions.
            After that you plan your solutions, then you make prototypes for your solution, then you test your prototypes, then you improve and start over again from the beginning.

            On thursday we did a challenge where we were split into two teams. Each team got 9 pvc pipes and we were supposed to carry a marble from one point into a cup.
            I thought it was alot of fun and i met alot of new people becuase of it.
            I thought that this week was extreamly fun and I think that I am going to love this class.

            <br>
            This week we learned about the saftey and discipline of engineering. We always need to tie long hair back, don't wear loose clothing, wear closed-toes shoes
            <br>
            always check your surroundings, no eating, never work alone, and always clean after yourself. Don't mess around and stab people.
            <br>
            In the image below we had our second challenge day. I was a judge so I did not work on a project but I helped other people make theirs.
            <br>

            This week was alot of fun. We stated working on our rube goldberg projects and ours is coming along well. I am building the rube goldberg machiene with my friends Noah and Evan. 
            <br>
            We have four different simple machienes including a lever, wheel and axel, wedge, and ramp.
            <br>
            <img src="Cad.png" width="400px" height="240px">
            <br>
            Above is what our rube goldberg machiene will look like. The goal of the machiene is to use a baseball and through using chain reactions, will pop a balloon.
            <br>
            The most challenging part of this will probably be balaning the cones to perfectly hit the wheel.

            <br>
            Last week was alot of fun, we finished our rube goldberg machienes and tested them this week. We had a wheel, a ramp, a lever, and wedges in our project.
            <br>
            My project coulde have been better if we used cups out of cardbourd and added a bigger ramp. Our project worked sucsefully but could have been much better.

            This project was alot of fun to work on and very interesting. The following week we learned more about computer enegineering.
            <br>
            We leaned about computers, quantum compters, and other stuff too. 
            <br>
            We also did multiple challenges like manufacturing an E with mesurments. 
            <br>
            <img src="E.png" width="400px" height="240px">
            <br>
            We wrote down the blue prints and had to make someone elses E and not everyones turned out as they thought it would.

         This week we disected computers and laptops. I really like computers and learning more about them. I thought i knew aabout a computer before but now i know even more.
         <br>
         I have a computer at home and i built it myself. I ddint know alot about my coputer when i was building it but now i know all about it. The cpu(centeral proccesing unit) controls the computer.
