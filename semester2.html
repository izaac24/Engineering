       <h2> <b>This is my first website update</b></h2>
       This week we Started designing our mousetrap car. I am teamed up with Jack. 
       We are going to make our mousetrap car go super far.
       Our design is to make a longer car with a long rod so our car can go far. We will havea small wheel to axel ratio so we can be as efficent as possible.
       <br>
       I want to make sure that we not only make a good functioning car but also learn the engineering
       procces further in depth.
       This next quarter will be alot of fun.

        1. Last weekend i played over 10 hours of dnd and pathfinder
        <br>
        2. This week we started a new project with a mousetrap car. 
        <br>
        3.Our design is to be very light so our car does not have to carry to much weight.

        5.Next week i hope to complete the cad and start building the body of our first car.

        <h2><b> This is my third website update</b></h2>
        This week me and jack wanted to finish our first mouse trap car.
        We calculated that our car would go around 60 feet so we hope to see that happen.
         <img src=Mousetrapcar1.heic width="600px" height="480px">
            <h2><b>This is my third website update</h2></b>
            <br>
            This week we finished our car and went 60 feet. Our car had an 11 inch rod with a 30 inch string. Our next car will have a longer rod and 
            <br>
            a longer string. Our car next time will also have one wheel that will dcrease the weight and will be better.
            <br>
            <h2><b>This is my fourth website update</b></h2>
            Me and Jack this week finished our second mousetrap car. In competition, our car went around 50 feet.
            We achived our goal of around 45 feet so we were very happy about this. Our first car went around 45 feet.
            <br>
            Our second car went around 55 feet on one of the runs. Our first car had 4 wheels and was bending when we streched the rod all the way. Our second car had an extra layer of cardboard to stp the bening and had one wheel in the back to have less weight.
            <br>
            Our thrid car would still have one wheel, would have 1 less layer of cardbourad, and our wheel would be much much bigger.

            We probably should have made our wheels more straight and the cardboard should have been stronger.
            
            <h2><b>This is my fifth website update</b></h2>
            <br>
            This week we started our new project. We are trying to make a device or container to help an egg survive a drop of around 30 feet.
            Our design is going to consist of a trianglar pyramid that is surounded by straws. There will also be two parachutes slowing the fall of our egg.
            <br>
            The weakest point on our egg device is probly the cushioning. We should add more cushioning becuase our egg might break on impact.

            <h2><b>This is my sixth website update</b></h2>
            <br>
            Our eggdrop went pretty well. The egg container started falling slowly but then picked up its pace and then hit the ground.
            I was opening the container to get to the egg but as I was opening it I stuck my finger through the egg. The egg was already slightly cracked but with the massive muscles in my middle finger, my finger went straight through the egg.

            This spring break, im going to teach jack how to ice skate and sleep alot and body slam jack into the wall. Hopefully i will also get to go to a robotics meeting.

            <h2><b>This is my sixth website update</b></h2>
            This week we started a project where we have to make a boat travel 500 centimeters.
            <br>
            me and malakai stated to cad our boat this week and finished it just in time and we think our boat will be a good boat.
            <img src=cadoftinyboat.png width="600px" height="480px">
            jack was not very good at ice skating. He fell over quite a bit and was not very cordinted with skating.
            <br>
            i really want to bench 200 pounds at the end of this school year!
            <br>
            <h2><b>This is my seventh website update</b></h2>
            This week we completed our boat project. Me and my partner finished making our cad last week so this week we started making the boat in real life.
            <br>
            My partner was not here for part of the project so i started out making the boat on my own and it started off rough but then he came back and we pulled the boat together.
            <br>
            Our boat did okish in the gutter. We did a sail boat design and it started off really good cause we didnt have to even blow on the boat but then the boat got stuck on the side of the gutter.
            <br>
            Me and my partner tried blowing on the boat but it didnt budge.
            <br>
            I think our boat looked pretty cool and was very durable.

            <br>
            This week we started working on our final.
            <br>
            It is a big boat challenge where we have to go across the pool and back in a cardboard boat. The cardboard boat must hold two people.
            <br>
            Last week we completed a post-it note bridge to see how long we could make it with 20 post-it notes.
            <br>

            This next year im looking forward to benching 200 punds on a bench press.
            <h2><b>This is my ninth website update</b></h2>
            <br>
            This past week we started building our boats. We cut the triangle out but we couldnt do anything more cause we didnt have any more cardboard.
            <br>
            <h2><b>This is my tenth website update</b></h2>
            This week we continued working on our boat. We finished three sides and are about to finish the fourth side.
            <br>
            I think apple juice is disgusting compared to orange juice. Orange Juice is crazy good with or without pulp. Its packed with fiber and vitamin C.
            <br>
            Orange Juice is just beatiful. Orange is a amazing. Orange Juice is the most delicious juice ever.
            <br>
            Sunrise in a glass,
            <br>
            Citrus whispers on the breeze,
            <br>
            Orange juice, pure bliss.

            This week we are going to finish the bottom and sides of our boat and reinforce eveything. Were also gonna make cool desgins on the boat.
            <h2><b>This is my eleventh website update</b></h2>
            This week we have made quite a bit of progress on our boat. We have almost completely finished our boat. We just have to add some reincforcements to the bottom and sides and then we will be done.
            <br>
            This past weekend Me and my siblings got out of the house so my mom could chill and be alone. We also had a nice dinner and gave her presents after dinner.
